                <h3>  Cuba </h3>
                <p>Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean. It’s also the least expensive. Besides low-cost living, tourists are drawn by perfect winter weather and more than 300 white sandy beaches lapped by turquoise seas. Highlights include the dramatic karst landscapes of Viñales Valley, Spanish colonial towns such as Trinidad and the capital city itself. Havana belongs in another era, with its vintage American cars, art deco architecture and lack of violent crime.</p>

                <h3> Cook Island</h3>
                <p>Cook Islands holidays are an experience of a lifetime. The Cook Islands are a stunning necklace of islands in the sun and are the jewel in the crown of the South Pacific island groups. The culture, traditions, arts and crafts are distinct from all others in the Pacific. The Cook Islands are like nowhere else, you feel so naturally at one with the island way of life. And how cool is a government that legislates that no building can be higher than the tallest coconut palm? Another great bonus with Cook Islands tourism over neighbouring French Polynesia is the local currency, the New Zealand dollar, which has a most attractive exchange rate against the US dollar, UK pound or Australian Dollar. So, welcome to the Cook Islands, immerse yourself in another culture... another time. Kia manuia! - May good fortune shine on you!</p>

                  <h3> Overseas Highway</h3>
                  <p>The Overseas Highway, the southernmost leg of U.S. Highway 1 and sometimes called, "The Highway That Goes to Sea," is a modern wonder. The road, that follows a trail originally blazed in 1912 by Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad, stretches from Miami to Key West. Today, motorists can travel the highway in less than four hours from Miami. However, drivers should allow time to experience the natural beauty of the ever-changing scenery of the seas and wilderness bordering the roadway, and the magnificent sunrises and sunsets.</p>

                  <h3> Route 66</h3>
                  <p>Since 1926, driving down Route 66 has been the experience of a lifetime for travelers, adventurers, desperados, and dreamers. The romance of Route 66 continues to captivate people around the world. Running between Chicago and Los Angeles, “over two thousand miles all the way” in the words of the popular R&B anthem, this legendary old road passes through the heart of the United States on a diagonal trip that takes in some of the country’s most archetypal roadside scenes. If you’re looking for great displays of neon signs, rusty middle-of-nowhere truck stops, or kitschy Americana, do as the song says and “get your kicks on Route 66.”</p>

                  <h3> Pacific Highway</h3>
                  <p>For some reason, when people elsewhere in the country refer to the Pacific Coast, particularly California, it’s apparent that they think it’s a land of kooks and crazies, an overbuilt suburban desert supporting only shopping malls, freeways, and body-obsessed airheads. All this may be true in small pockets, but the amazing thing about the Pacific Coast—from the dense green forests of western Washington to the gorgeous beaches of Southern California—is that it is still mostly wild, open, and astoundingly beautiful country, where you can drive for miles and miles and have the scenery all to yourself.</p>

                  <h3> Columbia River Highway</h3>
                  <p>Words fail many travelers who drive the exquisite Historic Columbia River Highway. Every twist and turn brings a new treasure, from majestic waterfalls, including Multnomah Falls, the most visited natural site in Oregon, to astounding views from the tops of cliffs over 900 feet above the river. During the spring, the Gorge area erupts into magnificent wildflower displays, including many plants that only exist in this area. The construction of this Highway was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of the modern age. Its engineer, Samuel C. Lancaster, did not [want] to mar what God had put there. It was designed in 1913 to take advantage of the many waterfalls and other "beauty spots."</p>
